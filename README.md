# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic rock paper scissors game built using JavaScript. The game allows a player to choose one of three options (rock, paper, or scissors) and then plays against the computer, which also chooses an option at random. The winner is determined based on a simple set of rules: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper.
